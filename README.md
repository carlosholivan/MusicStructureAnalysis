Music Structure Analysis is a research part in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Since 2009, MIREX's campaigns have been tested
this algorithms which are composed by unsupervised and end-to-end methods which both of them take as inputs audio features such
as MFCCs, chroma vectors or spectrograms, and the well-known self-similarity lag matrices.

In this repository, we show how these input matrices are obtained following previous works. The code has been programmed in the 
University of Zaragoza, in the Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications.

The actual files are:
